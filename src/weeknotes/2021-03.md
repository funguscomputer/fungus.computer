I wanted to have three things at the end of this week:

1. a new song
2. the first half of a fiction story
3. the first version of a static site generator

I only succeeded in getting the first thing done. The other too are _so close_. Maybe that means I'll have them done at the end of next week. Maybe it means they will never be done.

I guess I'm ok with either of those potential futures.

Here's the song:

I'm learning a few hardware synthesizers by creating midi tracks in Ableton Live, sending the midi signal over usb, and then recording the audio output of the synths back into Live.

I've got some issues to work out with a couple of the synths making weird crunch noises. Still, though, I'm pretty happy with the grumbly, grimy noises these things are making.
