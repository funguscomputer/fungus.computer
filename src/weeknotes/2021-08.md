At the end of this week I got access to OpenAI's beta API for GPT-3. It is so much fun. Maybe over the next week I'll share some fun results from prompts that I've sent.

## Links
- [AI Dungeons](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing) is a cool use of GPT-3
- [Futureland.tv](https://futureland.tv) looks like a fun way to keep a journal
- I really like this [@realscientists](https://twitter.com/realscientists) twitter account that features scientists, researchers, clinicians, writers, communicators and policy makers talking about their lives and their work on a rotating basis.
