A couple weeks ago I mentioned that I was messing with the OpenAI GPT-3 API.

This shit is fun.

I've been working on a short fiction story for a while and got completely stuck. I abstracted the plot to its most basic elements and turned that into a prompt for the davinci engine.

The results were surprising. Many of them were completely unusable garbage. Others were valid directions that the story could go. My favorites were the ones that weren't directly usable, but got me thinking about new directions the story could go.

This is an interesting use case for GPT-3. As the fiction story progresses, who really wrote the story? How should GPT-3 be credited? If no text generated by GPT-3 is used, if even the ideas it generates are changed before use, and considering the work that went into formulating the prompt given to GPT-3, what is the right way to frame the involvement of AI in the story? This is a fun problem to ponder.
