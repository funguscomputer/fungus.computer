This week I spent a little more time on [earthball](https://github.com/funguscomputer/earthball) adding the ability to generate a global atom & json feed for a site.

## Links

- [desm](https://github.com/mcollina/desm) is a nice Node.js wrapper module for getting the dirname from `import.meta.url`. This solves one of the more annoying aspects of moving to ecmascript modules: there's no longer a `__dirname` variable.
- [looom](https://iorama.studio/) is a fun tool for creating animations on ipad and may be perfect for creating animated gifs that act as story illustrations or graphics for marketing websites.
  - Creating canvas or webgl exports of looom animations might be possible with this [looom-tools](https://github.com/mattdesl/looom-tools) project.
- [Hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra) is an interesting tool for live coding visuals that can be used with p5.js.
