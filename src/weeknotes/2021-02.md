I've been learning to make songs with ableton live and hardware synths. There's still a lot to learn, but so far I've got one song put together:

Music has been a welcome distraction from the world.

## Other miscellanous notes
- I'm learning [deno](https://deno.land) and really appreciating the design decisions that went into it.
- I'm slowly learning rust and I'm not sure that I'm really a target user for this language. Making games with rust sure does feel like a valid use case though.
- Finding a job that is both meaningful and that leaves time for other practices like music shouldn't be so hard.
