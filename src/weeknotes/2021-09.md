This week I started a new project with [Deno](https://deno.land) that is basically a tiny CMS that uses sqlite3.

It's a fun little project for learning more about SQL, command-line tools, HTTP, filesystems, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, markdown, documentation, and more.

It's a way for me to learn more about those things and hopefully for others to learn those things as well. After spending quite a few years with Node.js, learning Deno has been really fun and refreshing. I'm a fun of the recently added built-in functionality for compiling executables.

The project I'm working on is not quite ready to share with the world, but hopefully soon!
