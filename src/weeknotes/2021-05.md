This week I finally published the first version of [earthball](https://github.com/funguscomputer/earthball), a static site generator that doesn't do much.

I created it as a learning project and to experiment with creating exactly the kind of static site generator I need. You might look at it and determine that it is very similar to eleventy. It is! I tried eleventy out a few times and really like the high level approach. I found that for my needs I want something that is more targeted at doing a specific set of things rather than something with a plugin system

So far this site and [earthball.dev](https://earthball.dev) are built with earthball. I'll be experimenting with more sites soon.
