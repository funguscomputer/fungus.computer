      <p>This is my first week existing on the world wide web as funguscomputer. It's a weird feeling.</p>
<p>It's not my first time existing on the web. I've been around for a bit.</p>
<p>Lately I've been struggling with motivation. I've had zero interest in code, design, reading, researching, or any of the things I associate with being on the web.</p>
<p>Over the last few years I completely lost the sense of wonder and curiousity I used to feel when I first learned about the web and what could be found through it.</p>
<p>This week those feelings started to return. I started having new ideas, started finding websites that were new to me, started feeling like I might be interested in being on the world wide web again.</p>
<p>This week I've been tinkering with various static site generators and did a first draft of a new one of my own. I haven't made a repository for it yet but may if it turns out to be useful for my sites.</p>
<p>I've also put together some fun synth music. I hope to share those songs soon.</p>
<p>It's weird to feel hope, to feel interested in publishing this kind of work again.</p>
<p>Maybe it will continue.</p>
