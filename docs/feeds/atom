        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first week existing on the world wide web as funguscomputer. It's a weird feeling.</p>
<p>It's not my first time existing on the web. I've been around for a bit.</p>
<p>Lately I've been struggling with motivation. I've had zero interest in code, design, reading, researching, or any of the things I associate with being on the web.</p>
<p>Over the last few years I completely lost the sense of wonder and curiousity I used to feel when I first learned about the web and what could be found through it.</p>
<p>This week those feelings started to return. I started having new ideas, started finding websites that were new to me, started feeling like I might be interested in being on the world wide web again.</p>
<p>This week I've been tinkering with various static site generators and did a first draft of a new one of my own. I haven't made a repository for it yet but may if it turns out to be useful for my sites.</p>
<p>I've also put together some fun synth music. I hope to share those songs soon.</p>
<p>It's weird to feel hope, to feel interested in publishing this kind of work again.</p>
<p>Maybe it will continue.</p>

<p>Music has been a welcome distraction from the world.</p>
<h2>Other miscellanous notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>I'm learning <a href="https://deno.land">deno</a> and really appreciating the design decisions that went into it.</li>
<li>I'm slowly learning rust and I'm not sure that I'm really a target user for this language. Making games with rust sure does feel like a valid use case though.</li>
<li>Finding a job that is both meaningful and that leaves time for other practices like music shouldn't be so hard.</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to have three things at the end of this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>a new song</li>
<li>the first half of a fiction story</li>
<li>the first version of a static site generator</li>
</ol>
<p>I only succeeded in getting the first thing done. The other too are <em>so close</em>. Maybe that means I'll have them done at the end of next week. Maybe it means they will never be done.</p>
<p>I guess I'm ok with either of those potential futures.</p>
<p>Here's the song:</p>

<p>I'm learning a few hardware synthesizers by creating midi tracks in Ableton Live, sending the midi signal over usb, and then recording the audio output of the synths back into Live.</p>
<p>I've got some issues to work out with a couple of the synths making weird crunch noises. Still, though, I'm pretty happy with the grumbly, grimy noises these things are making.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I finally published the first version of <a href="https://github.com/funguscomputer/earthball">earthball</a>, a static site generator that doesn't do much.</p>
<p>I created it as a learning project and to experiment with creating exactly the kind of static site generator I need. You might look at it and determine that it is very similar to eleventy. It is! I tried eleventy out a few times and really like the high level approach. I found that for my needs I want something that is more targeted at doing a specific set of things rather than something with a plugin system</p>
<p>So far this site and <a href="https://earthball.dev">earthball.dev</a> are built with earthball. I'll be experimenting with more sites soon.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mcollina/desm">desm</a> is a nice Node.js wrapper module for getting the dirname from <code>import.meta.url</code>. This solves one of the more annoying aspects of moving to ecmascript modules: there's no longer a <code>__dirname</code> variable.</li>
<li><a href="https://iorama.studio/">looom</a> is a fun tool for creating animations on ipad and may be perfect for creating animated gifs that act as story illustrations or graphics for marketing websites.
<ul>
<li>Creating canvas or webgl exports of looom animations might be possible with this <a href="https://github.com/mattdesl/looom-tools">looom-tools</a> project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ojack/hydra">Hydra</a> is an interesting tool for live coding visuals that can be used with p5.js.</li>
