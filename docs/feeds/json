I've been around for a bit.</p>\n<p>Lately I've been struggling with motivation. I've had zero interest in code, design, reading, researching, or any of the things I associate with being on the web.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years I completely lost the sense of wonder and curiousity I used to feel when I first learned about the web and what could be found through it.</p>\n<p>This week those feelings started to return. I started having new ideas, started finding websites that were new to me, started feeling like I might be interested in being on the world wide web again.</p>\n<p>This week I've been tinkering with various static site generators and did a first draft of a new one of my own. I haven't made a repository for it yet but may if it turns out to be useful for my sites.</p>\n<p>I've also put together some fun synth music. I hope to share those songs soon.</p>\n<p>It's weird to feel hope, to feel interested in publishing this kind of work again.</p>\n<p>Maybe it will continue.</p>\n",

I abstracted the plot to its most basic elements and turned that into a prompt for the davinci engine.</p>\n<p>The results were surprising. Many of them were completely unusable garbage. Others were valid directions that the story could go. My favorites were the ones that weren't directly usable, but got me thinking about new directions the story could go.</p>\n<p>This is an interesting use case for GPT-3. As the fiction story progresses, who really wrote the story? How should GPT-3 be credited? If no text generated by GPT-3 is used, if even the ideas it generates are changed before use, and considering the work that went into formulating the prompt given to GPT-3, what is the right way to frame the involvement of AI in the story? This is a fun problem to ponder.</p>\n",
